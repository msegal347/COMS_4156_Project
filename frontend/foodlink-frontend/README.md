## ðŸ’¡ Project Description

Our preliminary idea is to develop a food redistribution service called FoodLink, with the intent of reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity. FoodLink will act as a redistribution service that interacts with inventory management and analytics services, and will orchestrate the equitable redistribution of resources from sources to sinks using optimization algorithms. Additionally, FoodLink will provide API endpoints for monitoring and analytics.
